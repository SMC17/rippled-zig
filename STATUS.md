# Status Pointer

This file is intentionally minimal.

The canonical project status is `PROJECT_STATUS.md`.

Use `PROJECT_STATUS.md` for:
- current gate outcomes (A-E),
- release decision (`GO` / `NO-GO`),
- claim-to-evidence mapping,
- known risks and blockers.

If this file conflicts with `PROJECT_STATUS.md`, `PROJECT_STATUS.md` is authoritative.
