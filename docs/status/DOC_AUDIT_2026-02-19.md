# Documentation Audit - 2026-02-19

Scope: repository docs audit against current `main` code and gate behavior.

## Audit Outcome
- Overall state: mixed
- Core entry docs: partially stale, now corrected in this pass
- Status docs: fragmented; canonicality exists but drift remains in legacy files
- Gate/docs alignment: improving, but still needs consolidation

## High-Severity Findings (Fixed In This Pass)
1. `README.md`: stale capability description (skeleton-only RPC framing, stale code-size claims).
2. `GETTING_STARTED.md`: stale workspace path (`rip-zig`), stale runtime/build commands, stale limitations.
3. `PROJECT_STATUS.md`: stale commit pointer and missing latest tranche evidence.

## Medium-Severity Findings (Outstanding)
1. `docs/ROADMAP.md`: contains legacy repo links (`rip-zig`) and stale task states.
2. `docs/status/PROJECT_SUMMARY.md`: legacy absolute paths and outdated execution posture.
3. `HONEST_PARITY_ASSESSMENT.md`, `PARITY_PROGRESS.md`, `READY_FOR_LAUNCH.md`, `READY_TO_LAUNCH.md`: historical docs risk confusion without explicit archival banner.
4. `ARCHITECTURE.md` and `docs/status/ARCHITECTURE_SOT.md`: overlap; should converge on one canonical architecture source.

## Low-Severity Findings
1. `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`: legacy contact domain naming (`rip-zig.org`) should be normalized.
2. Several docs still use `zig build` examples where local convention is now `./zig` and `scripts/run.sh`.

## Source-of-Truth Rules (Proposed)
1. Canonical operational truth:
   - `PROJECT_STATUS.md`
   - `docs/status/ARCHITECTURE_SOT.md`
   - `docs/status/AGENT_NATIVE_BACKLOG.md`
2. Historical narrative docs must include:
   - `Status: Archived` banner
   - link to canonical status files
3. Every capability claim must map to:
   - gate artifact or test path
   - explicit file references

## Execution Track To Vision
1. Track A: Documentation hard boundary (now -> short term)
   - add archival banners to legacy launch/progress docs
   - normalize command examples to `./zig` + `scripts/run.sh`
   - update roadmap references to current repo paths and milestones
2. Track B: Capability contract docs (short term)
   - publish machine-readable RPC contract index per live method
   - document profile policy matrix (`research` vs `production`) with allowlist/denylist
   - align Gate C fixture manifest docs with deterministic error contract policy
3. Track C: Agent-native lab docs (mid term)
   - add control-plane runbook for closed-loop test automation
   - add Gate D operational runbook (testnet secrets, cadence, trend thresholds)
   - add WASM experimentation design note and CI contract for hook/tooling path

## Immediate Next Doc Tasks
1. Add archival headers and pointers in legacy launch/progress docs.
2. Refresh `docs/ROADMAP.md` and `docs/ROADMAP_TO_PARITY.md` from current gate-backed backlog.
3. Add a new `docs/CONTROL_PLANE_POLICY.md` with production boundary semantics and examples.
